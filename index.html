    <h1><u>About Me</u></h1>
        <p>
            Hello !<br><br>
            My name is Nicolas, I'm 18 years old and I live in France.<br>
            I'm passionate about Computer Science and I'm on a journey to learn programming. <br>
            So far, I've learned Python and made many projects with it, and today I'm learning few languages like HTML, CSS as well as C++ <br>
            Being 18 years old means that I'll start in September 2022 my first year of Computer Science in the University Institute of Technology in La Rochelle, France <br>
            I'm interested in many subjects of Computer Science: Software, Cybersecurity, Video-games, Network and many more...<br>
            On this website (which I fully created) you can discover every project I've made so far <br>
            I also have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ow0Br_bUeDNpMAkDNR2bA"  target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> on which I make some videos around my project or random subjects <br><br>
            If you want to contact me for any reason, send a mail to: nirs123@protonmail.com
