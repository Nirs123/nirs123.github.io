                My name is Nicolas, I'm 18 years old and I live in France.<br>
                I'm passionate about Computer Science and I'm on a journey to learn programming. <br>
                So far, I've learned Python and made many projects with it, and today I'm learning few languages like HTML, CSS, C++, C#, Java, PHP and more...<br>
                I've started in September 2022 my first year of Computer Science in the University Institute of Technology in La Rochelle, France <br>
                I'm interested in many subjects of Computer Science: Software, Cybersecurity, Video-games, Network and many more...<br>
                On this website you can discover every project I've made so far. <br>

                <p class="project_text">
                    Neon City Brawl is a 2D Game which I started developping in May 2021. <br>
                    This game was made with Python and the Pygame module. <br>
                    The goal was to create a 2D Shooter game in a Cyberpunk Style. <br>
                    This project is so far the biggest project I've made. <br>
                    The project took a long time and was only finished in August 2022 because in the meantime I worked on other projects and I really started working on it since February 2022. <br>
                    You can see the code and download it on <a href="https://github.com/Nirs123/Neon_City_Brawl" target="_blank"> this GitHub repository</a> <br>

                    <br><br>

                    Here is a list of some of all the things I did for this project: <br>
                    -Design all the graphics which include the Background, the Levels Elements, the Characters and their Animations, Buttons and many more...<br>
                    -Create a Level Editor (also in Python) to create, edit and save level<br>
                    -Use CSV files and python's module to save and load levels on the game <br>
                    -Create all the move, gravity, colliding, shoot and many more functions and methods <br>
                    -Create a menu where you can play, choose your difficulty, change your settings... <br>

                    <br><br>

                    For more information on the project and how I made it, there will be another page completly dedicated to this project later. <br>

                <h2>World Of Boats</h2>
                <p class="project_text">
                    World Of Boats is also a 2D Game made with Python which I started developping in December 2021 and was finished in February 2022. <br>
                    This game is a board game inspired by 2 Games: World of Warship and Battleship. <br>

                    <br> <br>

                    Firstly, It was only a friend who created a command-in-line game with basic things when we learned Object-Oriented coding at school. <br>
                    Then, we worked together to create a command-in-line game with much more possibilites. <br>
                    After that, I created all the User Interface using Tkinter module. <br> 
                    
                    <br> <br>

                    This project is the first "serious" and personnal project and I think I created something great even if the code isn't clean and there is obviously a lot of coding mistake. <br>
                    It was a really great experience and this is with this project that I fell in love with coding, finding solutions to issues, building a Project on your own... <br>
                    
                    <br> <br>

                    To describe more precisely the game, when you first launch it, you land on a menu where you can add players (up to 3 players on the same team, there is only 2 teams) and select the boat class of the player. <br>
                    Here is the 4 boat class you can choose (some of the classes name are in french): <br>
                    -Cuirass√©: A Tank with a lot of Health and Resistance, big Range Attack, not a lot of movement and his type of attack are the shells. <br>
                    -Cruiser: All his stats (Health / Resistance / Range Attack / Movement / Attack Damage) are equilibrated, and his type of attack are both shells and torpedo. <br>
                    -Destroyer: A lot of Attack Damage and Movement but not a lot of Health and Resistance. His type of attack are both shells and torpedo. <br>
                    -Submarine: A lot of Attack Damage / Movement / Range Attack, a lot of Resistance to shells (he is a submarine...) but not a lot of Health. His attack type are the torpedos. <br>

                    <br>

                    After everyone is added to the game, you can start the game and the next step is to choose your bonus. 
                    Every class has his own bonus which can be more movement, health, range, attack damages, resistance and many other stats... <br>
                    
                    <br>

                    After everyone choosed, the game has started and you can play on a 20x20 square map. Every player of the red team spawn randomly on the left side of the map, and every player of the green team spawn randomly on the right side. <br>
                    The yellow circle is the range attack of the player which playing his turn. <br>
                    When a player play his turn, he has 4 possibilites (only 1 can be selected): skip his turn, attack someone, heal himself (only some classes have only few heals) and move.

                <h2>QR Code Generator</h2>
                <p class="project_text">
                    QR Code Generator is a project made in August 2022 that only took me a day to build. <br>
                    The goal of this project was only to start coding again before my 2022/2023 school year because I did not code for many months. <br>
                    This app is made with Python and Tkinter module. <br> 
                    Even tho it is a very small and easy project, it was still a great project to do and especially in one day. <br>

                    <br> <br>

                    To describe how I did this project, I firstly created a function to transform link to QR Code using the qrcode module. <br>
                    Then, I also created 2 more function: one to copy the QR Code into your clipboard, and the other one to save it. <br>

                    <br> <br>

                    After I did all the functions, I started working on the User Interface using Tkinter module. <br>
                    I only had few things to add: a Title, an Input to give the link, a Button to create the QR Code which will show the QR Code after the button is pressed, and 2 more buttons when there is a QR Code to copy into your clipboard and to save it. <br>

                    <br> <br>

                    With this project, I learned something very important: I made progress with coding. <br>
                    I realized that when I had this project idea, I already knew all the steps I've just told you, I already knew which functions I had to make, how the User Interface will look like... <br>
                    And this is completly different from my first project World Of Boats because when I started it, I didn't knew where to start, how to make it... <br>
